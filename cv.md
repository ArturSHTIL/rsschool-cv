### ***lyrical introduction***
*2 years ago I started my journey into the world of IT.*

*I started learning Python as an easy language, as I thought, and because my previous experience was in the field of architecture and construction  that was forced profession.*

*My main goal is to change my life. I think a person can do anything if he just wants to it, and everything in our life is in our hands.
My motivation is inside me, because nothing can force a person to do something without coordinating it with himself, really correctly and qualitatively.*

*I have some certificates from STEPIK education platform. I finished several education projects from JetBrains Academy.but I think I need the skills of a frontend developer to realize my potential more fully.*
